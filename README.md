Using Sponza to test performance cost of resource binding strategies in Vulkan

Note: The Amazon Bistro scene was too big to feasibly store in git, so I've instead committed a zip file called "bistro.7z" in the data/meshes folder that contains the interior and exterior meshes. You'll need to unzip those before running the program if you want to test the bistro scene. 

The Bistro Files were made public by Amazon and NVidia: https://developer.nvidia.com/orca/amazon-lumberyard-bistro
The Crytek Sponza files were made public by (no surprise) Crytek: http://www.crytek.com/cryengine/cryengine3/downloads
