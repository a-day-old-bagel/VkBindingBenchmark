Using Sponza to test performance cost of resource binding strategies in Vulkan

Note: The Amazon Bistro scene was too big to feasibly store in git, so I've instead committed a zip file called "bistro.7z" in the data/meshes folder that contains the interior and exterior meshes. You'll need to unzip those before running the program if you want to test the bistro scene.
